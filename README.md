# weatherApp

This is my weather app which utilizes an asynchronous fetch request to the openweather API, then displays the weather data to the user.

It is written dynamically with JavaScript. I used the webpack module bundler and utilized css-loader and html webpack plugins.

The color of the temperature background correlates to temperature and the wind arrow correlates to actual wind direction!

Unit preferences are adjustable and saved in localstorage, check it out in the menu.

Nav is responsive. Be sure to view it on mobile and desktop.
